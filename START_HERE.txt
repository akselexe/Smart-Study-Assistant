  SMART STUDY ASSISTANT - QUICK START
===========================================

STEP 1: Start XAMPP Services
-----------------------------
1. Open XAMPP Control Panel
2. Click "Start" for Apache
3. Click "Start" for MySQL
4. Wait until both show "Running" (green)

STEP 2: Configure API Key
--------------------------
1. Open: config/config.php
2. Replace 'your_groq_api_key_here' with your actual Groq API key
3. Get your API key from: https://console.groq.com/keys

STEP 3: Create Database
------------------------
1. Open your web browser
2. Go to: http://localhost/prog_project/setup.php
3. You should see success messages for each table created
4. The setup will create:
   - Users table (with role support)
   - Exercises table
   - Chat sessions and messages tables
   - Uploads directory for exercise files
5. IMPORTANT: If you already had a database, running setup.php will:
   - Add the 'role' column to existing users table
   - Create the new exercises table
   - Set all existing users to 'student' role by default
6. After setup completes, DELETE setup.php for security

NOTE: If you get "Unknown column 'role'" error during registration:
- Option 1: Run setup.php again (http://localhost/prog_project/setup.php)
- Option 2: Run the migration script (http://localhost/prog_project/migrate_add_role.php)
- Both are safe to run multiple times - they won't duplicate data
- After running either script, try registering again

STEP 4: Create Your Account

1. Go to: http://localhost/prog_project/register.php
